The Filecoin Community Grants Program empowers communities worldwide to drive growth and innovation in the Filecoin ecosystem through events, meetups, hackathons, and creative initiatives.

## About Filecoin

Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to store humanity's most important information. It turns cloud storage into an algorithmic market, allowing anyone to rent out spare storage space or purchase storage at competitive prices. Built on open-source protocols, Filecoin provides a secure, efficient, and decentralized alternative to centralized storage solutions.

## Our Mission

We fund projects that build community, drive adoption, and create meaningful impact across the Filecoin ecosystem. Whether you're organizing a large-scale event, hosting local meetups, running a hackathon, or creating educational content, we're here to support your efforts.
